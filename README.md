# michael humphries portfolio site

This app is a copy of the BBC iPlayer landing page, which is part of my web development portfolio. It has been produced using react, javascript, css and jsx. The page features carrousels and dropdown menus. It is fully responsive and has been adapted for both touchscreen and mouse control. Testing has been carried out on firefox, safari and chrome browsers.
